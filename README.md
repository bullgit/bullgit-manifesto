# the bullgit manifesto

[Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/iso/en/) did it wrong - this is the bullgit manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing

software by doing **bullgit** and helping others do **bullgit**.

Through this work we have come to bullshit:


Gitches and interactions over processes and tools

Bullshit software over comprehensive documentation

Forking collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to gitter over following a plan


That is, while there is value in the items on

the right, we value the items on the left more.
